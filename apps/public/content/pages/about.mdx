## Introduction

Hey there!

My name is [Carl-Gerhard Lindesv√§rd](https://x.com/CarlLindesvard). I'm the founder of OpenPanel. These days, knowing how your users use your product is super important.

I've worked with different analytics tools for over 5 years, and I've seen it all - the good, the bad, and the ugly.

I've mostly used Mixpanel along with tools like Google Analytics. Here's why I decided to start OpenPanel.

## Why

### Product analytics

Mixpanel is a solid analytics tool - it's easy to create reports and has tons of features. 

But I was only using a small part of it, mainly the reports. I wanted a simple way to see my custom events. Sure, Mixpanel lets you make nice reports with different charts like:

- Line charts
- Bar charts
- Pie charts
- Funnels
- Retention 
- ...and more

Being able to track what each user does was great too. But that was pretty much all I needed.

The problem? I had to pay $300/month for this. Their pricing makes no sense, especially since I only used a tiny bit of what they offer.

### Web analytics

Mixpanel does web analytics too, but not in a way that works for me. I just wanted a simple dashboard to quickly see how my website is doing. That's why I ended up needing a separate tool just for web analytics.

## The solution

That's why I built OpenPanel. It's a simple analytics tool that I actually use myself. It combines both product and web analytics:

- You get a clear picture of your website's performance and can dig deeper when needed
- You can build reports that show your data in ways that make sense to you 
- You can see what your users are doing, both individually and as a group
- Unlike Mixpanel, you can check your stats from your phone since our dashboard works great on mobile

## OpenPanel is a great alternative to Mixpanel
