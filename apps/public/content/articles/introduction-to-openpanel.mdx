Welcome to OpenPanel, the open-source analytics platform designed to be a robust alternative to Mixpanel and a great substitute for Google Analytics. In this article, we'll explore why OpenPanel is the ideal choice for businesses looking to leverage powerful analytics while maintaining control over their data.

## Why Open Source?

At OpenPanel, we are committed to the principles of open-source software. By making our code publicly available, we invite a community of developers and users to contribute to and enhance our platform. This collaborative approach not only fosters innovation but also ensures transparency in how data is managed and processedâ€”a crucial consideration in today's data-driven world. You can explore our code and contribute on [GitHub](https://git.new/openpanel).

## Why Choose OpenPanel?

Our journey began with a vision to create an open-source alternative to Mixpanel, a tool we admired for its product analytics capabilities. However, as we developed OpenPanel, we realized the potential to offer more comprehensive features that Mixpanel lacked, particularly in the realm of web analytics. While Mixpanel excels in product analytics, it doesn't fully address web analytics needs. OpenPanel bridges this gap by integrating both web and product analytics, providing a holistic view of user behavior.

## What Can You Do with OpenPanel?

OpenPanel is a versatile analytics platform that offers a wide array of features to meet your data analysis needs:

-   **Web Analytics**: Gain insights similar to tools like Plausible, Fathom, and Simple Analytics.
-   **Product Analytics**: Analyze product usage and user interactions, akin to Mixpanel.
-   **User Retention**: Track and enhance user retention rates.
-   **Funnels**: Visualize user journeys and conversion paths.
-   **Events**: Monitor specific user actions and interactions.
-   **Profiles**: Create detailed user profiles to better understand your audience.
-   **Real-Time View**: Display real-time data on a big monitor in your office for dynamic insights.
-   **Export API**: Seamlessly export your data for further analysis.
-   **Chart API**: Integrate custom visualizations into your dashboards.

## Commitment to Privacy

Privacy and data protection are at the core of OpenPanel's philosophy. We believe that your data is your property, and you should have full control over it. Our tracking script is fully open-source and complies with GDPR and CCPA regulations. Unlike many analytics tools, we do not use cookies to track users; instead, we utilize fingerprinting techniques similar to Plausible, ensuring user privacy without sacrificing functionality.

## Your Data is Safe with Us

At OpenPanel, your data security is our priority. We never sell your data to third parties. To sustain our service, we charge a small fee, but our pricing remains competitive with other analytics solutions. If you prefer, you can also self-host OpenPanel, maintaining complete control over your data. You can delete or export your data at any time, ensuring no vendor lock-in.

## Listening to Feedback

Our users are our greatest asset, and their feedback shapes the evolution of OpenPanel. We actively seek input from our community to refine existing features and introduce new ones that support business growth. Your suggestions drive our innovation, helping us deliver a product that meets your needs.
